Sportgems finds valuable gems ðŸ’Ž in your tracked sport ðŸš´ activity!


## What is it?
Sportgems lets you efficiently parse your activity data. It will search and find your
sections with either max velocity or max climb (see below). It will determine the start,
end and speed of whatever desired sections you are interested in, e.g. 1km, 2km, 10km
and others. 

Sportgems is used in [workoutizer](https://github.com/fgebhart/workoutizer) to find your
fastest 1km (and other ðŸ’Ž) in all your activities and visualize it. See for example this
screenshot of an activity in workoutizer, with the fastest 3km section being highlighted
in yellow:

## Installation
Sportgems is bundled in a python package using [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/). Simply
install it using pip:
```
pip install sportgems
```

The following interfacing functions are available:

| function name                    | purpose                                                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `find_fastest_section`           | parse your activity data to find the fastest section            |
| `find_fastest_section_in_fit`    | parse your activity `.fit` file to find the fastest section     |
| `find_best_climb_section`        | parse your activity data to find the best climb section         |
| `find_best_climb_section_in_fit` | parse your activity `.fit` file to find the best climb section  |
| `parse_fit_data`                 | parse your activity `.fit` file to get e.g. `timestamps`, `coordinates`, `altitude` and `calories` |

Have a look at the docstrings of these functions for more details.


## How to use it?

In order to search for gems ðŸ’Ž in your activity, pass a path and desired distance to e.g.
`find_fastest_section_in_fit` like:

```python
from sportgems import find_fastest_section_in_fit

desired_distance = 1_000  # in meter
path_to_fit_file = "tests/data/2019-09-14-17-22-05.fit"
result = find_fastest_section_in_fit(desired_distance, path_to_fit_file)
```
The result will be a python object with the following attributes:
```python
print(f'Found fastest section, from {result.start=} to {result.end=} with {result.velocity=} m/s')
```

which prints:
```
Found fastest section, from result.start=635 to result.end=725 with result.velocity=2.898669803146783 m/s
```

## How does it work?

The following diagram illustrates how the core algorithm (implemented in `gem_finder.cpp`) works:
