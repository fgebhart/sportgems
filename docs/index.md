# Find valuable gems ðŸ’Ž in your activities ðŸš´

`sportgems` is a library for parsing activity data. It can be used to either find the [fastest sections](module_reference.md#fastest-sections) or
the [best climb sections](module_reference.md#best-climb-sections).

## Installation
Sportgems is written in rust but bundled in a python package using [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/). Simply
install it using pip:
```
pip install sportgems
```

## Example Usage
In order to search for gems ðŸ’Ž in your activity, pass a path and desired distance to e.g.
`find_fastest_section_in_fit` like:

``` python
from sportgems import find_fastest_section_in_fit

desired_distance = 1_000  # in meter
path = "tests/data/2019-09-14-17-22-05.fit"
result = find_fastest_section_in_fit(desired_distance, path)

# start and end index of fastest 1000m section:
result.start            # 635
result.end              # 725

# average velocity (in m/s) during that 1000m section:
result.velocity         # 2.898669803146783
```
